### Change your computer name

Change your computer name to something more user friendly because we will be using this later on when configuring Liferay.

#### Linux

1.  Launch the *Terminal*
2.  Check your device name with the following command. If your hostname needs to be changed, follow one of the points in step 3.

```shell
hostname
```

3. Update hostname steps

   - Open *Settings* -> Click *Details* -> Click *About* -> Change *Device Name*

   - In your *Terminal* you can edit your *hostname* file with the following commands, then reboot to verify the changes were saved.

```shell
sudo nano /etc/hostname

sudo nano /etc/hosts // Change the line that starts with 127.0.1.1
```

#### OS X

1. Launch *System Preferences*.
2. Click on *Sharing*.
3. In the *Computer Name:* field, enter what you want your computer name to be.

#### Windows

1. Right click on *My Computer* and choose *Properties*.
2. On the *Computer Name, domain, and workgroup settings* section, click the *Change Settings...* link.
3. Click the *Change...* button under the *Computer Name* tab.
4. In the *Computer Name:* field, enter what you want your computer name to be.

### Change your folder options

Show *hidden* files in the *Finder/File Explorer* because Liferay contains hidden files that we need to edit.

#### Linux

Hidden files in *File Explorer* should be visible by default

Viewing files through the terminal should use the list and all options

```shell
ls -la
```

#### OS X

1. Launch the *Terminal*.
2. Enter the command below.

   ```shell
   defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
   ```

3. Relaunch the Finder to make the changes take effect.

   ```shell
   killall Finder
   ```

#### Windows

1. Click the *Start Menu* and search for *Folder Explorer Options*.
2. Click on the *View* tab .
3. Under the *Advanced settings:* section, make sure *Show hidden files, folders and drives* is selected.
4. Make sure *Hide extensions for known file types* is unchecked.

### Set ANT_OPTS environment variable

`ANT_OPTS` is an environment variable that provides a list of arguments that you want to pass to the Java Virtual Machine that will run Ant.

#### Linux

1. Create a `.bashrc` if one does not already exist.
2. Enter the contents below into the `.bashrc`.
   ```shell
   export ANT_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx4096m"
   ```

#### OS X

1. Create a `.bash_profile` if one does not already exist.
2. Enter the contents below into the `.bash_profile`.
   ```shell
   export ANT_OPTS="-Xms2048m -Xmx4096m"
   ```

#### Windows

1. Right click on *My Computer* and choose *Properties*.
2. Click on the *Advanced system settings* link.
3. Click on the *Environment Variables...* button.
4. Click on *New...* under the *User variables* section. We will be setting the `ANT_OPTS` environment variable.
5. Fill out the field values with *Variable name:* being `ANT_OPTS` and *Variable value:* being the `-Xms2048m -Xmx4096m`.
6. Click *OK* to save this environment variable.

### Setup Apache Ant

Ant does almost everything for you; it uses scripts to automate tasks and compile Liferay. You should have already downloaded the [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) in the previous step. This will help you install and set it up.

#### Windows

1. Unzip the downloaded file from the previous step into your `C:\ drive`.
2. Go to your Ant directory in the *File Explorer* and copy the path from the address bar.
3. Right click on *My Computer* and choose *Properties*.
4. Click on the *Advanced system settings* link.
5. Click on the *Environment Variables...* button.
6. Click on *New...* under the *System variables* section. We will be setting the `ANT_HOME` environment variable.
7. Fill out the field values with *Variable name:* being `ANT_HOME` and *Variable value:* being the **Apache Ant path you copied in step 2**.
8. Click *OK* to save this environment variable.
9. Verify that the `ANT_HOME` variable is correct.
10. In the *Environment Variables* window, go to the *System variables* section and look for a variable called `PATH` and click *Edit...*.  This variable should already exist and have values in it.
12. **Do not delete this variable**. At the beginning of this variable, enter the code below. We are adding our `ANT_HOME` variable to the `PATH` variable.

    ```shell
    %ANT_HOME%\bin;
    ```

13. Open a new *Command Prompt*.
14. Enter the command below in the *Command Prompt* to make sure Ant is installed correctly. A message *Buildfile: build.xml does not exist! Build failed*.

    ```shell
    ant
    ```

### Setup Java JDK

Liferay is written in Java, so you will need Java on your machine in order to have it run. You should have already downloaded the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html#jdk-8u101-oth-JPR) in the previous step. This will help you install and set it up.

#### Linux

1. Extract the downloaded `tar.gz` file from the previous step.
2. Create the following directory structure if it does not exist: `/usr/lib/jvm`

   ```shell
   mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm
   ```

3. Copy the extracted java folder to the newly created `jvm` directory
4. Create a symbolic link pointing to the `java` executable

   ```shell
   sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/JAVA_DIRECTORY_NAME/jre/bin/java /usr/bin/java
   ```
5. To check if Java is installed, launch the *Terminal*.
6. Enter the command below in the *Terminal* to make sure Java is installed correctly. A message regarding your Java version should be displayed. Make sure your version displayed matches the Java JDK version you downloaded.

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

#### OS X

1. Double-click the downloaded installer from the previous step. (The installer should be in `.dmg` format).
2. Follow the prompts to install the Java JDK.
3. To check if Java is installed, launch the *Terminal*.
4. Enter the command below in the *Terminal* to make sure Java is installed correctly. A message regarding your Java version should be displayed. Make sure your version displayed matches the Java JDK version you downloaded.

    ```shell
    java -version
    ```

5. Find the path where Java is installed on your machine by running the command below in the *Terminal*.  A file path should return if Java is installed correctly.

    ```shell
    which java
    ```

6. Copy the returned file path as it will be the value of the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable we will be setting.
7. Create a `.bash_profile` if one does not already exist.
8. Create a `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by entering the contents below in the `.bash_profile`.  Use the value that was returned in Step 5 as the value of the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

    ```shell
    export JAVA_HOME="Paste your Java file path returned in step 5 here"
    ```

9. Verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is correct.
10. Append this newly created `JAVA_HOME` environment variable at the beginning of your `PATH` environment variable.  If a `PATH` environment variable in your `.bash_profile` does not already exist, enter the contents below in the `.bash_profile`.

    ```shell
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

11. Save your `.bash_profile`.
12. Relaunch the *Terminal*.
13. Enter the command below in the *Terminal* to make sure your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly.  The returned results should match what you have entered as the value for your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your `.bash_profile` and what is returned from Step 5.

    ```shell
    echo $JAVA_HOME
    ```

13. Enter the command below in the *Terminal* to make sure your `PATH` environment variable is set correctly.  The returned results should have the file path from your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable or the returned value from Step 5 at the beginning of your value.

    ```shell
    echo $PATH
    ```

#### Windows

1. Double-click the downloaded installer from the previous step.
2. Follow the prompts to install the Java JDK.
3. Go to your Java JDK directory in the *File Explorer* and copy the path from the address bar.
4. Right click on *My Computer* and choose *Properties*.
5. Click on the *Advanced system settings* link.
6. Click on the *Environment Variables...* button.
7. Click on *New...* under the *System variables* section. We will be setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
8. Fill out the field values with *Variable name:* being `JAVA_HOME` and *Variable value:* being the **Java JDK path you coped in step 3**.
9. Click *OK* to save this environment variable.
10. Verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is correct.
11. In the *Environment Variables* window, go to the *System variables* section and look for a variable called `PATH` and click *Edit...*.  This variable should already exist and have values in it.
12. **Do not delete this variable**. At the beginning of this variable, enter the code below. We are adding our `JAVA_HOME` variable to the `PATH` variable.

    ```shell
    %JAVA_HOME%\bin;
    ```

13. Open a new *Command Prompt*.
14. Enter the command below in the *Command Prompt* to make sure Java is installed correctly. A message regarding your Java version should be displayed. Make sure your version displayed matches the Java JDK version you downloaded.

    ```shell
    java -version
    ```

15. Enter the command below in the *Command Prompt* to check if your `PATH` variable is set correctly. It should list the directory of your JAVA JDK.

    ```shell
    path
    ```
