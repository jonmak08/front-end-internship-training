## What is CSS?

* CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheet**.
* CSS defines the *look and feel* of HTML elements on a web page.
* CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
